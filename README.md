Overview: In our abstract game, the player is trapped in an abandoned control room within an unknown abandoned complex. Armed with nothing but a basic control panel, the player must fend off a unkown entity inching closer and closer to them. Lock doors, set motion triggers, and check the contents of every room carefully in order to survive for as long as possible- and make your action carefully, because you only have so many actions per turn before the entity makes its next move...

Configuration commands and settings can be found before the game starts with the HELP command. To start the game, use the START command. During the game, you can always use the HELP command to refresh yourself on the controls.
